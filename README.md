# GMTK18-EnterTheSpaceship

This is my entry for the [Game Maker's Tookit Jam 2018](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2018). 

A platformer without gravity. 
This "idiot" wants to enter this spaceship, risking his life to the eternal emptiness of space. Fortunately, he has magnetic boots, so as long as he remains on the ground, he should be fine.

Arrow keys to move, Space to activate/deactivate magnetic boots. Gamepad supported.
